2. set up: div with container class; y default, the container is centered in the page with a max width of around 1140px.
3. creat a full-width grid: <div class="container-fluid">...</div>
4. bootstrap grid has 5 breakpoints
5. fluid layout is the grid stretches all the way out to the edge of the page (by container-fluid class)

#### Reponsive desigh
1. the column class (eg. col-12) in Bootstrap must be the direct child of row class, otherwise it will break the responsive design 
2. 2 columns in middle size screen and 3 columns in large screen need to use d-md-none and d-lg-block in the same row
